I"R<p>This is a five page extract from the broader data review that was conducted in September of 2009 around the issues of carers.</p>

<p>This document relates to data pulled from the County Council’s social care database and that of the Carer’s Support Service. Included are data on the former LAA Carers Assessment Review target, and further details on the circumstances of care.</p>

<p>This does not represent all the carers in the county (thought to be roughly 10% of the population - Census 2001) but it gives an idea of the level of support currently provided by social services.</p>
