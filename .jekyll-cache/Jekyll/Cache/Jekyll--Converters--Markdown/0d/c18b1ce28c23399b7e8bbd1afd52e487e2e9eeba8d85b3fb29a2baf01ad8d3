I"}<p>The following questions concern opening and waiting times for each GP surgery in Crawley CCG.</p>

<p>Respondents to the GP Patient Survey were asked to rate how satisfied they were with the opening hours of their GP (<em>very satisfied</em> to <em>very dissatisfied</em>), and how they feel about the waiting times at their surgery (<em>donâ€™t normally have to wait too long</em> to <em>have to wait far too long</em>).</p>

<p>The figures show the proportion of respondents who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>were <strong>satisfied</strong> with the opening times of their GP surgery</li>
  <li>and how they <strong>feel</strong> about the length of the waiting times at their surgery</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the number of patients taking part in the survey varies by practice. Wide confidence intervals suggest smaller sample sizes and therefore less certainty in the results.</p>
