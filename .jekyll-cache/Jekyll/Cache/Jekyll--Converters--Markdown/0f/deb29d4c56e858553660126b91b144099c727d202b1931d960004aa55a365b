<h4 id="HHS01">Health and Happiness Survey 2019</h4>
<p><small>Date added: 05/08/2019</small></p>
<p>Children and young people’s mental health and emotional wellbeing are key priorities for Public Health and the council and are central to the work of partner organisations working to improve children’s lives. However, very little information is available about these priority areas with regard to younger children in particular, nor about their lifestyle choices. We therefore proposed that research should be undertaken to help fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge. This took the form of a Health and Happiness Survey of 10 to 11-year old children.</p>

<p>The survey links in with the work of Public Health and supports the Public Health Plan, the West Sussex Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2019-2024, the Wellbeing and Resilience Framework 2018 and the West Sussex Local Transformation Plan for Children and Young People’s Mental Health and Emotional Wellbeing 2015-2021.</p>

<h4 id="SACE19">Analysis of the West Sussex 2011 Year 11 cohort</h4>
<p><small>Date added: 24/08/2012</small></p>
<p>This report looks at educational attainment of Year 11 Pupils in 2011 at Key Stage 4 (GCSE) along with pupil progress in core subjects (English, Maths and Science) between Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4.</p>

<p>79% of students achieved 5+ A<em>-C grades in all subjects, while 59% of students achieved 5+ A</em>-C grades when including English and Maths.</p>

<p>This is similar to the national figures but compares averagely with neighbouring counties.</p>

<p>The results also show that there is a strong correlation between social deprivation and educational attainment, particularly for Maths and Science.</p>

<p>Variations in attainment were also observed between districts with a higher percentage of pupils from Horsham achieving grade A*-C compared to pupils in Adur.</p>

<p>Exclusion from school either temporarily or permanently is associated with poorer attainment. Pupils that have been excluded (between September 2007 and December 2010) were 3 times less likely to achieve 5+ A*-C grades (including English and Maths) compared to non-excluded pupils.</p>
