<p><small>Date added: 22/08/2014</small></p>
<p>A Community Survey was undertaken in West Sussex in February to May 2014.</p>

<p>Almost 4,000 people across the county were surveyed; it was a household face-to-face survey.</p>

<p>The survey used nationally and internationally validated questions on a range of issues including volunteering in the community, social networks and isolation (both in the general population and amongst older people), local concerns, assets and social action.</p>

<p>The background questions used, wherever possible, the same format as the Census 2011.</p>
