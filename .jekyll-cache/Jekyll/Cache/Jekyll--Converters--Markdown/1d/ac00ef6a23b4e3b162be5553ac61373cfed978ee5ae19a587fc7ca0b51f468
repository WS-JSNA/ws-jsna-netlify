<h4 id="YP06">West Sussex mental health needs assessment (children and young people) June 2014</h4>
<p><small>Date added: 16/06/2014</small></p>
<p>This needs assessment looks at the emotional wellbeing and mental health of children and young people in West Sussex; in the main people aged 0-18 years of age, in some instances up to 25 years.</p>

<p>The information collated aims to answer some basic questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the characteristics of the population aged 0-24 years in West Sussex?</li>
  <li>What are the risk factors and protective factors affecting the mental health and emotional wellbeing of the population?</li>
  <li>What are the mental health, emotional and behavioural conditions and needs requiring commissioned services?</li>
  <li>What services are currently provided to meet those needs?</li>
  <li>How well are services currently provided to meet those needs?</li>
  <li>What gaps/barriers, if any, need to be addressed?</li>
</ul>

<p>While a range of data have been collated, at the heart of this work are the experiences and views of children and young people, parents, carers and professionals. The needs assessment was conducted by researchers in the Public Health, Health and Social Care Commissioning Directorate,
with consultation fieldwork undertaken between October 2013 and December 2013.</p>
