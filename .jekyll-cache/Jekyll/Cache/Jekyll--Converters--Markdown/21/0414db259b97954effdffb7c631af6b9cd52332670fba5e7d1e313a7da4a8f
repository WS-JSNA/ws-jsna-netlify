<p>This workbook has been drafted to adapt the Projecting Adult Needs and Service Information (PANSI) model developed by the Institute of Public Care (commissioned by the Department of Health).

This has been locally adapted to use WSCC population projections are used (as opposed to ONS projections).</p>
