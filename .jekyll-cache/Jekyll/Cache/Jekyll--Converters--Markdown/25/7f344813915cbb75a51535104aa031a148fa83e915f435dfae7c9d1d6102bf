I"ë<p>In May 2016, West Sussex County Council commissioned the Institute of Public Care at Oxford Brookes University to provide a comprehensive needs assessment of the life pathway for people with disabilities. A number of methods were used to obtain a qualitative assessment of the needs of people with disabilities across the life pathway, including workshops, interviews, and surveys of both staff and families.</p>

<p>As part of the â€˜discoverâ€™ phase of a longer-term project to redesign of services, the comprehensive needs assessment of the life pathway for people with disabilities in West Sussex aimed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review evidence on good practice</li>
  <li>Describe and map current pathways</li>
  <li>Assess what is working well and what needs improvement</li>
  <li>Gather and review existing stakeholder views</li>
  <li>Gather information on support services, e.g. transport, community provision</li>
  <li>Compare West Sussex with other local authorities</li>
</ul>

<p>The project was carried out in five stages: epidemiological analysis, evidence review, mapping of current needs and services, comparison with other local authorities, and the preparation of this final report and recommendations.</p>
