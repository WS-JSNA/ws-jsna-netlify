<h4 id="SACE08">Carers service data - September 2009</h4>
<p><small>Date added: 23/12/2011</small></p>
<p>This is a five page extract from the broader data review that was conducted in September of 2009 around the issues of carers.</p>

<p>This document relates to data pulled from the County Councilâ€™s social care database and that of the Carerâ€™s Support Service. Included are data on the former LAA Carers Assessment Review target, and further details on the circumstances of care.</p>

<p>This does not represent all the carers in the county (thought to be roughly 10% of the population - Census 2001) but it gives an idea of the level of support currently provided by social services.</p>
