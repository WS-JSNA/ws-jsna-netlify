<p>Since 1 April 2013, every Health and Wellbeing Board (HWB) in England has had a statutory responsibility to publish and keep up to date a statement of the need for pharmaceutical services of the population within its area. This is referred to as a Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA). The PNA:</p>

<ul>
  <li>looks at the current provision of pharmaceutical services across the West Sussex HWB area;</li>
  <li>assesses whether service provision meets the current and future needs of the population and;</li>
  <li>identifies any potential gaps to service delivery.</li>
</ul>

<p>The PNA is a key document which is used by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NHS England to inform decisions about applications for new, or changes to existing pharmaceutical services, and the commissioning of NHS-funded services that can be provided by local community pharmacies.</li>
  <li>Local authorities and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG) when commissioning services to meet local health needs and priorities.</li>
</ul>
