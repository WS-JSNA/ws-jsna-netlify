I"^<p>Each Health and Wellbeing Board has a statutory duty to revise and publish a Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA) within 3 years of its previous publication. The PNA looks at the provision and availability of pharmaceutical services provided by pharmacies, dispensing doctors and appliance contractors. It is used by NHS England, Clinical Commissioning Groups and Local Authorities in making decisions about pharmaceutical services. It also contains information about West Sussex such as population growth, age profiles, deprivation and local health and wellbeing priorities.</p>
