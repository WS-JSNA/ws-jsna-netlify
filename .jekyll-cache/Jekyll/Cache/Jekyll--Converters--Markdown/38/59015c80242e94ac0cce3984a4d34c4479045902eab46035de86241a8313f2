I"º<p>High blood pressure (hypertension) is very common, affecting more than 1 in 4 adults in England <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/404881/Tackling_high_blood_pressure_-_FINAL.pdf">(PHE - Tackling high blood pressure action plan)</a>. If left untreated, high blood pressure can increase the risk of a number of serious conditions, for example heart failure, heart attacks, kidney disease and stroke. Whilst improvements in treating high blood pressure have prevented or delayed many thousands of premature deaths, at present only 4 in 10 adults with high blood pressure are aware of their condition and are receiving the recommended treatment.</p>
