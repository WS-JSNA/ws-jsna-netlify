<p>The mid year population estimates show us how many people live per square kilometre, as a measure of population density (how many people share a unit of space).</p>

<p>Lower-layer super output areas (LSOAs) are small area geographies designed to improve the reporting of local area data. There are 32,844 LSOAs in England, and boundaries are coterminous with local authority boundaries and clinical commissioning groups.</p>

<p>LSOAs are defined from census data (e.g. the latest update is 2011) so that each LSOA has an average of 1,500 residents or 650 households. The consistency in population size helps with reporting of area based statistics whereas other small area boundaries such as wards or parishes tend to change frequently and do not always hold a consistent population size. LSOAs are not coterminous with wards and parish boundaries.</p>

<p>There are 505 LSOAs in West Sussex and each LSOA has a code and name which reflects the district or authority it is in (e.g. Arun 002A). These names are not particularly helpful for locating an area on a map. As such, whilst LSOAs are not coterminous with ward boundaries, if you click on an area the name of the closest ward is given for reference.</p>
