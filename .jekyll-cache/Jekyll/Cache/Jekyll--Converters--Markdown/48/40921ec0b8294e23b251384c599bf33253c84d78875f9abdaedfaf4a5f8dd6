I"þ<p>NHS Digital have released the <a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=23381&amp;q=national+child+measurement+programme&amp;sort=Relevance&amp;size=10&amp;page=1#top">National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP)</a> results for the 2015/16 school year.</p>

<p>Children in reception class (aged 4 to 5 years) and year 6 (aged 10 to 11 years) have their height and weight measured to assess overweight and obesity levels in children within state-maintained primary schools. This data is used at a national level to support local public health initiatives and inform the local planning and delivery of services for children.</p>

<p>The West Sussex Public Health and Social Research Unit have completed a <a href="/assets/core/Final-Data-Briefing-1516-National-Child-Measurement-Programme.pdf">data briefing (NCMP: 2015/16)</a> to summarise childhood obesity prevalence at a local level.</p>

<h3 id="key-facts">Key Facts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In England, <strong>over a fifth</strong> of reception children were overweight or obese, and in year 6 it was over a <strong>third</strong>. Nationally, the prevalence of obesity has <strong>increased</strong> since 2014/15 in both reception and year 6.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In West Sussex, prevalence of obesity was <strong>lower than national</strong>, but not regional levels; with 19.9% of reception age children (4-5 years old) and 30.4% of year 6 children (10-11 years old) measured as overweight or obese.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within local authorities, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is varied. For both school years, there was no significant change in the percentage of overweight/obese children for any one local authority within West Sussex compared to the previous year.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
