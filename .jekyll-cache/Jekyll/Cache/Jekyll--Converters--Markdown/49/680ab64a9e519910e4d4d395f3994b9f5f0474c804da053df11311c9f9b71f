I"£<p>The following questions concern ease of access to each GP surgery in Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG.</p>

<p>Respondents to the GP Patient Survey were asked to rate how easy they found it to get through to their surgery on the phone (<em>very easy</em> to <em>not at all easy</em>), how helpful the receptionists at the surgery were (<em>very helpful</em> to <em>not at all helpful</em>), and how often they were able to see or speak to the GP of their choice (<em>always, or almost always</em> to <em>Never or mostly never</em>).</p>

<p>The figures show the proportion of respondents who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>felt it was <strong>easy</strong> to get through to someone on the phone</li>
  <li>felt that the receptionists at their surgery were <strong>helpful</strong></li>
  <li>felt that they saw the GP of their preference <strong>most of the time</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the number of patients taking part in the survey varies by practice. Wide confidence intervals suggest smaller sample sizes and therefore less certainty in the results.</p>
