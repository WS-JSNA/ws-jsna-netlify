<h2 id="what-is-the-joint-strategic-needs-assessment">What is the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment?</h2>

<p>The Joint Strategic Needs Assessment is an assessment of the needs and assets of the local population. It provides a summary of the current and future health and wellbeing needs of the people of West Sussex and uses a broad range of indicators to monitor outcomes. It uses national and local data to build a comprehensive picture of the local population.  The JSNA provides an analysis of national and local data including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>demographic data about the local population (such as age, gender and ethnicity)</li>
  <li>wider determinants of health such as education, housing, crime and employment</li>
  <li>data on health behaviours such as smoking, physical activity, alcohol use and dietary habits</li>
  <li>Data on the distribution of health  and determinants of health related states and events in the local population  such as life expectancy, quality of life, and prevalence of diseases and conditions</li>
  <li>access and use of services  such as hospital admissions, discharge, GP service usage data</li>
  <li>evidence of effectiveness such as guidelines of the NICE, quality standards, good practice examples</li>
  <li>Resident and service user views</li>
</ul>

<p>The JSNA is used by the Health and Wellbeing Board to develop the Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy, which sets out how the HWB will meet the needs identified in the JSNA Both the JSNA and JHWS are used by decision makers, commissioners, and providers in planning, commissioning and providing services that address local needs and improve outcomes for residents.</p>
