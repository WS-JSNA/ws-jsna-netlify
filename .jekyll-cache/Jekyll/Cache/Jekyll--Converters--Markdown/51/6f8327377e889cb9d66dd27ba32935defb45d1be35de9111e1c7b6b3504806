<h4 id="EY01">Briefing - Child Disability Estimates</h4>
<p><small>Date added: 30/01/2017</small></p>
<p>This briefing incorporates work undertaken by the Institute of Public Care for West Sussex County Council as part of the needs assessment of people born with or who acquire a lifelong disability.</p>

<p>The briefing provides an estimate of the number of children living in West Sussex who have a disability and outline the sources of data and background to the assumptions made. This information is important to aid the planning of services and support to children, young people and their families.</p>

<p>There is no single definition of disability and therefore providing a single accurate estimate is difficult; for example the 2011 Census definition of disability is: ‘A long-term health problem or disability that limits a person’s day-to-day activities, and has lasted, or is expected to last, at least 12 months’; the Family Resources Survey (FRS) uses a different definition: ‘a long-standing illness, disability or impairment which causes substantial difficulty with day-to-day activities’. Estimating the number of children and young people according to “severity” or in terms of specific needs or conditions is also problematic. This briefing provides the background to the basis estimates have been made.</p>
