I"È<p>The following questions concern the overall experience patients have at their GP surgery in Coastal West Sussex CCG.</p>

<p>Respondents to the GP Patient Survey were asked to rate if they would recommend their GP surgery to someone who has just moved to the local area (<em>Yes, would definitely recommend</em> to <em>No, would definitely not recommend</em>) and to rate the overall experience of their GP surgery (<em>very good</em> to <em>very poor</em>). Respondents who reported long-term conditions were also asked to rate if they felt that they had had enough support from local services or organisations to help manage their long-term health condition/s in the past 6 months (<em>Yes, definitely</em> to <em>No</em>).</p>

<p>The figures show the proportion of respondents who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>would <strong>recommend</strong> their surgery to someone who has just moved to the local area</li>
  <li>felt that the overall experience of the GP surgery was <strong>good</strong></li>
  <li>felt that they have had <strong>enough support</strong> from local services to help manage long-term health condition/s</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the number of patients taking part in the survey varies by practice. Wide confidence intervals suggest smaller sample sizes and therefore less certainty in the results.</p>
