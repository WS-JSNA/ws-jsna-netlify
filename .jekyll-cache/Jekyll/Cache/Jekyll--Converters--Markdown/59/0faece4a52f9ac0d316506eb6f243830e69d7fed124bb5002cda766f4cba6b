<h4 id="LEX09">Disability free life expectancy by ward, 2001</h4>
<p><small>Date added: 01/10/2015</small></p>
<p>Number of years a person can expect to live without developing a long term limiting illness by electoral ward based on data from the 2001 Census.</p>

<p>These data have been downloaded from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) rather than locally calculated. It is based on a combination of life expectancy by ward calculations for the period 1999-2003 inclusive and self reported assessments of limiting long term illness from the census (not medical diagnosis).</p>

<p>Further notes on the methodology are included within the document.</p>

<p>Disability free life expectancy is very strongly correlated with deprivation and varies even more than life expectancy.</p>
