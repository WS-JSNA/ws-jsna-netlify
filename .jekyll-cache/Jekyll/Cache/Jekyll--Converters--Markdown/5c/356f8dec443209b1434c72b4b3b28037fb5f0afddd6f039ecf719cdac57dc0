<p>The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) for England records height and weight measurements of children in state-maintained schools in reception (aged 4-5 years) and year 6 (aged 10-11 years) and provides high-level analyses of the prevalence of
‘underweight’, ‘healthy weight’, ‘overweight’, ‘obese’ and ‘combined overweight and
obese’ children.</p>

<p>This briefing summarises the analyses for children measured in West Sussex schools, and is taken from the report “National Child Measurement Programme: England, 2013/14 school year”, published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre in December 2014.</p>
