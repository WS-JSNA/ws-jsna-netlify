I"¿<p>The West Sussex Public Health and Social Research Unit have now completed the annual population profiles (formerly data packs) for the three Clinical Commissioning Groups in West Sussex:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/ccgs/coastal/">NHS Coastal West Sussex CCG</a></li>
  <li><a href="/ccgs/crawley/">NHS Crawley CCG</a></li>
  <li><a href="/ccgs/horsham/">NHS Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These profiles are a powerful tool to examine variations in the health and wellbeing of people across West Sussex, and can help commissioners identify potential priorities for change.</p>

<p>The 2015/16 profiles have been redesigned to help users access information as quickly as possible on the web. <a href="/ccgs/">You can view the West Sussex CCG pages here</a> or use the links above.</p>
