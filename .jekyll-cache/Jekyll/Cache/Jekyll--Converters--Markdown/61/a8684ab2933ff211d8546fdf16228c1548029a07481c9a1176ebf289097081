<p>This workbook has been drafted to adapt the Projecting Older People Population Information System (POPPI) model developed by the Institute of Public Care (commissioned by the Department of Health). This resource brings together various prevalence assumptions relating to health and social care needs of older people â€“ people aged 65 years or over. There is a corresponding model for working aged adults called PANSI. This has been locally adapted to use WSCC population projections are used (as opposed to ONS projections).</p>
