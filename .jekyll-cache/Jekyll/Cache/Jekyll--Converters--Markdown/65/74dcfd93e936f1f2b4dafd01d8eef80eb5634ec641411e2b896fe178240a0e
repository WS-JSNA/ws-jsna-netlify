I"÷<p>There are a variety of ways in which the population of West Sussex are divided up. We might compare West Sussex county to other counties or we might look at smaller areas within the county; from output area, to ward, to district and CCG. West Sussex also forms part of the wider Sussex and East Surrey Sustainable Transformation Footprint.</p>

<p>A detailed explanation of the different geographies available for official statistics is available on the <a href="http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/">Office for National Statistics Open Geography Portal</a>.</p>

<p>The map below shows the main boundaries that are used in West Sussex. Click on an area to find out more about the populations covered in each area. You can also see the Sussex and East Surrey Sustainable Transformation Footprint.</p>
