<h4 id="DAA13">West Sussex Drug Related Death Audit 2019</h4>
<p><small>Date added: 15/10/2019</small></p>
<p>Deaths from drug poisoning affect a wide spectrum of residents in West Sussex. Whilst younger men account for a larger proportion, deaths are not attributable to a single cohort or demographic and as such, efforts to reduce early death require attention in many different areas.</p>

<p>This newly designed audit covers a three-year period (2015 to 2017) of all deaths from drug poisonings registered by the West Sussex coroner. It examines personal details; information relating to death; toxicology; mental health and social disorders; contact with services in the community; and thematic summaries of contexts and mechanisms leading to death.</p>

<p>Geographic areas have been identified as more concentrated areas of drug misuse deaths and outreach work can be targeted to these areas. Resolving the issues of compounding mental health problems appear to be a primary issue in reducing deaths from drug poisonings across a full spectrum of West Sussex residents. Messages around dangers of alcohol mixed with medications or other substances may need to be reconsidered or refocused.</p>

<h4 id="DAA01">West Sussex alcohol and drugs needs assessment; final report 2014</h4>
<p><small>Date added: 16/06/2014</small></p>
<p>In undertaking the needs assessment researchers examined evidence, reviewed activity and provision alongside national guidance and best practice, and engaged with a wide range of local stakeholders.</p>

<p>In relation to specific gaps in services and/or unmet needs, the report noted the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There should be an increased emphasis on recovery. As a matter of urgency there should be clear linkages with maternity services, specialist inpatient services and some specialist adult social care.</li>
  <li>There should be increased provision, and improved mapping, of peer support and self-help groups.</li>
  <li>There should be stronger integration with mental health services to ensure that the needs of people with a dual diagnosis are addressed.</li>
  <li>Commissioners should examine the access and take up of services by people from diverse groups, including BME groups, and people living in rural areas.</li>
  <li>Examine why there is apparent under-use of some services, including the Structured Day Service and the local residential Tier 4 detox and rehab service.</li>
  <li>Commissioners should review the assessment panel process for Tier 4 and also ensure that that Tier 4 treatment options should be considered at the start of a treatment journey not as √íthe last resort√ì.</li>
  <li>Work should be undertaken to improve staff wellbeing and morale, including sickness and stress levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>There were a number of recommendations specifically relating to children and young including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved support for children and young people with parents/carers with substance misuse problems (including improved identification of children of substance misusers), improved staff training, expand provision of Alcohol Identification and Brief Interventions, ensure adequate early intervention programmes and improved co-ordination of school education work.</li>
</ul>

<p>The needs assessment also highlighted the issue of poor quality infrastructure and noted that significant investment was required to ensure buildings are fit for purpose.</p>
