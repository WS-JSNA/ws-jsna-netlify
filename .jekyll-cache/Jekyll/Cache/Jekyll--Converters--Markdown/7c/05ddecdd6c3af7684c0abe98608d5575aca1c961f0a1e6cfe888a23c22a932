I"p<p>The <a href="/HWB/">Health and Wellbeing Board</a>, <a href="/https://www.westsussexscp.org.uk/">Safeguarding Children Partnership</a>, <a href="https://www.westsussexsab.org.uk/">Safeguarding Adults Board</a> and the <a href="https://www.westsussex.gov.uk/fire-emergencies-and-crime/crime-prevention/safer-west-sussex-partnership-swsp/">Safer West Sussex Partnership</a> recently launched their Collaborative Working Agreement. This ‘Partnership of Partnerships’ brings together key systems leaders from across West Sussex and aims to improve the impact of services and the lives of residents in the county.</p>

<p>During the launch, the Public Health Directorate took part in a market place exhibiting the four boards’ priorities and progress. As part of this, the research team put together several infographic posters which highlight the work on progressing the priorities within the <a href="/assets/core/FINAL-JHWS-2019-2024.pdf">West Sussex Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2019-24</a> and the links with community safety (particularly drugs, alcohol and serious violence).</p>
