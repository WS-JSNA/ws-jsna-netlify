I"!<p>The attached file brings together all of the indices and population bases used in the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) 2010, 2007 and 2004.</p>

<p>Values are highlighted in blue or dark blue where they lie in the bottom 20% or 10% nationally and light yellow or dark yellow where they lie in the top 20% or 10%.</p>

<p>Each index is made up of a series of sub-indicators, these are not included within this document but may be downloaded from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) website. \n\nIndex values are an adjusted distribution and are not comparable year on year or against each other as they are not a linear scale. Relative national rank is instead used to compare LSOAs year on year but this will not give an indication of absolute deprivation (with the exception of the Income Deprivation (INC), Employment Deprivation (EMP), Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) and Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index (IDAOPI), which are percentages of their respective sections of the population).</p>
