I"h<p>This briefing details the information published by the Department of Communities and Local
Government (DCLG). The Indices of Deprivation 2019 (ID2019) updates the 2015 indices.</p>

<p>The ID2019 measures relative deprivation, i.e. how deprived one area is compared with another; it
doesnâ€™t measure absolute deprivation, i.e. how deprived an area is compared with how deprived it was
a year ago.</p>

<p>The overarching methodology for the IMD remains, with the seven domains of deprivation unchanged: -
income, employment, education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, and living
environment.</p>

<p>While the methodology for most of the domains has remained the same, some minor changes have
been made to the Income domain due to the move towards Universal Credit.</p>

<p>For each domain there is an individual score and ranking, information from the domains are weighted
and combined to provide an overall score and ranking.</p>
