I"w<p>The West Sussex JSNA is not a single document or piece of analysis but encompasses a huge range of work, including detailed needs assessments relating to specific subjects or communities, evaluations of new local programmes or activities, local surveys and a range of briefings and ad hoc analyses.</p>

<p>The volume of data, the frequency information is refreshed and the breadth of subjects covered can make the process of identifying issues and priorities a considerable challenge. Therefore to support the development of the West Sussex Health and Wellbeing Strategy and to, hopefully, provide a clear summary of population-level health, we have moved to producing a set of smaller ‚Äúbite-sized‚Äù products.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This summary is a brief run through of the health and wellbeing issues at county level. It will be updated annually.</li>
  <li>Infographics at county and District and Borough level relating to needs and assets.</li>
  <li>A summary of ‚Äúvoice‚Äù. This will provide a brief overview of the main public, patient and service user engagement exercises over the last year. This will be jointly produced with Healthwatch, and again will be annual.</li>
  <li>Datasets relating to children and young people and older people.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout this summary there are indicators that are part of different outcome frameworks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Public Health Outcomes Framework (PHOF)</li>
  <li>Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework (ASCOF)</li>
  <li>NHS England Outcomes Framework (NHS OF)</li>
  <li>CCG Outcome Indicator Set (CCGOIS)</li>
</ul>

<p>These indicators change frequently, so footnotes provide background detail, the outcome reference etc. We have also noted measures which are targets in the County Council‚Äôs West Sussex Plan (2017-2022).</p>

<p>This summary is split into four sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an overall section on environment, population , assets and wealth/poverty</li>
  <li>a section on each broad lifestage:- childhood (start well), working age (living well) and older age (ageing well).</li>
</ul>
