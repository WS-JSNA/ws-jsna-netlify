<h3 id="mothers-under-the-age-of-20">Mothers Under the Age of 20</h3>

<p>Young mothers (first time mothers under the age of 20) are a target group for the work of the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP). Not all hospital maternity records used a “flag” for first time mothers, therefore the information provided relates to all mothers under the age of 20. The majority of these women will be first time mothers. Of the total number of live births in Crawley CCG, 3.9% were to women under the age of 20 years.</p>

<h3 id="low-birth-weight">Low Birth Weight</h3>

<p>In 2013, approximately 7.9% of live births in Crawley were of low birthweight (less than 2.5kg). This equates to around 120-130 live births in Crawley in 2013.</p>

<h3 id="fertility">Fertility</h3>

<p>The total fertility rate (TFR) is the average number of children that a group of women would each bear if they experience the age-specific fertility rates of the calendar year in question throughout their childbearing lifespan. It provides a snapshot of the level of fertility in a particular year and does not necessarily represent the average number of children that a group of women will have over their lifetime.</p>

<p>Birth statistics for England and Wales are based on the details collected when births are registered. By law, births should be registered within 42 days.</p>

<p>The TFR for Crawley, West Sussex and England have followed a similar pattern over the past 5 years.</p>

<h3 id="under-18-conceptions">Under-18 Conceptions</h3>

<p>Conception data combine information from registrations of births and notifications of legal abortions occurring in England and Wales for women who are usually resident there. Conception statistics include pregnancies that result in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One or more live, or stillbirths (a maternity)</li>
  <li>A legal abortion under the Abortion Act 1967</li>
</ul>

<p>They do not include miscarriages or illegal abortions.</p>

<p>The date of conception is estimated using recorded gestation for abortions and stillbirths, and assuming 38 weeks gestation for live births. A woman’s age at conception is calculated as the number of complete years between her date of birth and the date she conceived.</p>

<p>In Crawley, the rate of under-18 conceptions has been steadily decreasing. In 2014, the under-18 conception rate in Crawley was 24.9 per 1,000 women aged 15-17 years (95% CI: 18.1 – 33.4), significantly lower than in 2009 (42.1 per 1,000 women aged 15-17; 95% CI: 33.6 – 52.2). This is comparable to the national rate at 22.8 per 1,000 women aged 15-17 years (95% CI: 22.5 – 23.1).</p>
