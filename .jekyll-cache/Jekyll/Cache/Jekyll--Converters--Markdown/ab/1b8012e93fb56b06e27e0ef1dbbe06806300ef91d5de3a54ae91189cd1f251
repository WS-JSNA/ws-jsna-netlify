<p>Total population estimates are rounded to the nearest 100 although figures for births, deaths and migrations are unrounded.</p>

<p>To enable comparison between GP registrations and estimates of residents, we have compared the snapshot of GP registrations as close to the time of the estimates as possible (July 2018). There are more recent snapshots available (GP practice lists are updated monthly) and some practices will have closed since July 2018.</p>
