<p><strong>Note:</strong> The projections included in this report show projected change to 2036. These are subnational population projections (SNPP) that were produced by the ONS in 2016, and are based on the 2014 mid-year population estimates. As a result, these estimates are based on the old CCG boundary where four lower-layer super output areas (LSOAs) were formerly assigned to Guildford and Waverley CCG. This is reflected in the difference between the total population size presented in the projection table below, and the <a href="#population-estimates">mid-year estimates table</a>, and equates to a deficit of around 7,000 residents. As such, the projections for Coastal West Sussex (particularly for later years) are likely to underestimate the projected population size of the CCG area when the new boundary is taken into account.</p>
