<h1 id="technical-information-about-this-websites-accessibility">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h1>

<p>West Sussex County Council is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

<p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>

<h2 id="non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>

<p>It is not always possible for our content to be accessible. Where content is likely to create a barrier, we will state a reason, warn users and offer alternatives.</p>

<p>We are currently auditing our website and will list here the areas that we know are not fully accessible and what we are doing to fix these issues.</p>

<h2 id="content-thats-not-within-the-scope-of-the-accessibility-regulations">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>

<h3 id="pdfs-and-other-documents">PDFs and other documents</h3>

<p>Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to understanding public health issues in West Sussex. For example, we have PDFs with information about services, and how many people access them. Whilst most of our documents can be read by a screen reader, some older files may not be as accessible. By September 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.</p>

<p>The accessibility regulations <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made">do not require us to fix PDFs or office file formats published before 23 September 2018</a> if they’re not essential to providing our services.</p>

<p>Any new PDFs or office file formats we publish will meet accessibility standards.</p>

<h3 id="maps">Maps</h3>

<p>The accessibility regulations <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/made">do not require us to fix maps that are not supplied for the purpose of navigation</a>. Maps for displaying data are not currently accessible but we will provide accessible alternatives when technology allows. In the meantime, please <a href="mailto:JSNA_at@westsussex.gov.uk">contact us if you require assistance with our data maps</a>.</p>

<h2 id="screen-readers">Screen readers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Windows comes with a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/search?query=Start%20Narrator">basic screen reader called Narrator</a>, which reads text on the screen aloud and describes some events (such as an error message appearing) that happen while you’re using the computer. You can <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22798/windows-10-complete-guide-to-narrator">find more information on how to use Narrator on the Microsoft website</a>.</li>
  <li>For Mac users, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/accessibility/mac">MacOS has built-in text to speech and vice-versa functions</a>, which you can access by going to ‘System Preferences’ and selecting ‘Universal Access’.</li>
</ul>

<p>For downloaded files, such as PDFs and word documents, you can use the Read Aloud function on Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Word.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/reader/using/accessibility-features.html#use_a_screen_reader_or_magnifier">To use Read Aloud on Adobe Acrobat</a>, you can access this by going to ‘View’, selecting ‘Read Out Loud’ then ‘Activate Read Out Loud’.</li>
  <li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-a-screen-reader-to-explore-and-navigate-word-a16a93f4-163f-4f48-a246-78c2573d8953">To use Read Aloud on Microsoft Word</a>, go to ‘Review’ and select ‘Read Aloud’.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="screen-magnification">Screen Magnification</h2>

<p>Screen magnification allows you to greatly increase text size. However, the magnified area will only be a small portion of the original screen, and the greater magnification you use, the less of your screen you’ll be able to see.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/11542/windows-use-magnifier-to-make-things-easier-to-see">All recent versions of Microsoft Windows include magnification software</a>. To magnify your screen, click on ‘Start’ then select ‘Programmes’ followed by ‘Accessories’ and ‘Magnifier’. You can then select the amount of magnification you want from the dialog box that will appear on screen. On Windows 10 or later systems, go to ‘Start’ then ‘Windows Ease of Access’ then ‘Magnifier’.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/mac/vision/">For Mac users, you can select the screen magnifier</a> option by going to ‘System Preferences’ and selecting ‘Universal Access’.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mobile-devices">Mobile devices</h2>

<p>This website is designed to be viewable on all devices, using a “mobile first” design approach. However, some media embedded on these pages may be more easily viewed on a larger screen. We recommend using at least a tablet-sized device to view this website.</p>
