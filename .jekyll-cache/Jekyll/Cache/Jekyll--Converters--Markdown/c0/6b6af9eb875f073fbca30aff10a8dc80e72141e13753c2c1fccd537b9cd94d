I""<p>In January 2015 there were 1,125 deaths registered in West Sussex, this was 34% higher than January 2014 registrations (837).</p>

<p>This section summarises the mortality data available for the population of West Sussex.</p>

<p>The Primary Care Mortality Database (PCMD) holds records of the underlying cause for each death. This is based on an international classification of diseases (the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision, ICD-10, World Health Organization, 2016) which identifies the medical condition judged to be the underlying cause of death.</p>

<p>Underlying cause of death can be defined as the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.</p>

<p>The underlying cause may be a long-standing, chronic disease or disorder that predisposed the patient to later fatal complications.</p>

<p>Direct age standardised rates are calculated by applying local age specific death rates to the local population as if it had the age structure of the standard population. This is a way of controlling for biases in age structure between different populations.</p>
