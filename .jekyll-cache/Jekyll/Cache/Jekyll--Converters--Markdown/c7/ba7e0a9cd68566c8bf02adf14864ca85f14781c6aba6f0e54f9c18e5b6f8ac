I"Í<p>The West Sussex <a href="/partners/">Health and Wellbeing Board</a> has now published its new <strong><a href="/assets/core/FINAL-JHWS-2019-2024.pdf">Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy 2019 â€“ 2024: Start Well, Live Well, Age Well</a></strong> (JHWS). The strategy sets out the Health and Wellbeing Boardâ€™s vision, goals and ways in which it will work to improve the health and wellbeing for all residents in West Sussex. It was developed in consultation and collaboration with local residents, service users, multi-disciplinary professionals and partners. It draws on evidence of West Sussexâ€™s health and wellbeing needs from the joint strategic needs assessment (JSNA).</p>

<p>The JHWS is not a stand-alone document, but sets the direction of travel for health and social care services in West Sussex. Decision makers, commissioners and service providers across the County Council, CCGs, NHS Trusts, district and borough councils, the voluntary sector and other partners are expected to consider the JHWS when planning, commissioning and providing services that impact on health and wellbeing.</p>

<p>The JHWS identifies the following goals to meet the health and wellbeing needs of the residents of West Sussex:</p>
