I"2<p>The Director of Public Health (DPH) has a statutory duty to publish an Annual Public Health Report that details the state of health within the local population. This year’s Annual Public Health Report outlines a joined up approach to health and wellbeing across the public, voluntary, community and private sector to promote health and wellbeing and prevent ill health across West Sussex.</p>

<p>Key messages from the report are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Public health is everyone’s business</li>
  <li>Health is not just about health and social care services. To improve health we need to work together on the wider, social determinants of health</li>
  <li>Health and wellbeing benefits need to be felt by all – West Sussex has considerable health inequalities</li>
  <li>To tackle complex problems, such as obesity, we need to work at different levels; working with individuals, families, friends; the wider community and at a population level.</li>
  <li>Population-level approaches are likely to be the most cost-effective, but require sustained commitment as benefits are often delivered over a longer time period</li>
  <li>Placing Health at the heart of all our business will deliver many additional ‘co-benefits’.</li>
</ul>
