I"M<p>The CCG Outcomes Indicator Set (CCG OIS) aims to provide CCGs and Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) with clear, comparative information about the quality of the healthcare services they provide, and their associated health outcomes. The CCG OIS indicators are developed from NHS Outcomes Framework indicators that can be measured at CCG level, as well as indicators developed by NICE, and NHS Digital (formerly HSCIC). The indicators contribute to the 5 domains in the NHS Outcomes Framework:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Preventing people from dying prematurely</li>
  <li>Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions</li>
  <li>Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury</li>
  <li>Ensuring that people have a positive experience of care</li>
  <li>Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm</li>
</ol>

<p>The indicators in the CCG OIS are not intended to set thresholds of performance, and instead aim to drive improvements in care, and encourage consideration of local priorities. Due to the wide range of data sources used to create the indicator set, some are updated on a quarterly basis, whilst others are updated annually. A quarterly summary is released by NHS Digital (March, June, September and December).</p>

<p>The NHS Digital Indicator Portal provides access to the data, details on how indicators are constructed, data quality, statistical methods and interpretation considerations (including possible caveats). In addition, an annual “at a glance guide” and technical specifications are available from NHS England.</p>
