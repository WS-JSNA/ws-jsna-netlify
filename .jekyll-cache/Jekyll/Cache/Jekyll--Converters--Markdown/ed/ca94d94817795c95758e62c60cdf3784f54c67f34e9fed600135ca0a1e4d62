<p>Directly age standardised rates are calculated by applying local age specific death rates to the local population as if it had the age structure of the standard population.</p>

<p>This is a way of controlling for biases in age structure between different populations.</p>

<p>Circulatory diseases are defined as those with an ICD-10 code of I00 -I99, for more information see http://www.nchod.nhs.uk</p>

<p>This spreadsheet contains a 15 year trend and the ability to compare between local authorities.</p>
