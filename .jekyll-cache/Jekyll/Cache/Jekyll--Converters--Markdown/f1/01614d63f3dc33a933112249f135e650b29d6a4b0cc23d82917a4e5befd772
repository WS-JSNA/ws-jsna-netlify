<p>Children are classified as obese using the population monitoring definitions of weight status and using the following UK90 population thresholds.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Underweight: &lt;= 2nd centile</li>
  <li>Healthy weight: &gt; 2 to &lt; 85th centile</li>
  <li>Overweight: &gt;= 85th centile</li>
  <li>Obese: &gt;= 95th centile</li>
</ul>

<p>These thresholds are lower than the thresholds used in the definition of clinical overweight and obesity; this is to capture those children with a weight problem and those at risk of developing a weight problem (i.e. those children who may be on the border line of the clinical definition). This helps ensure that adequate services are planned and delivered for the whole population.</p>
