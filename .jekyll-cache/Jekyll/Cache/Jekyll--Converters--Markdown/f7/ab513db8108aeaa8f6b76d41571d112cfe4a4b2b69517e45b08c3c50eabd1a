<h4 id="YP06">West Sussex mental health needs assessment (children and young people) June 2014</h4>
<p><small>Date added: 16/06/2014</small></p>
<p>This needs assessment looks at the emotional wellbeing and mental health of children and young people in West Sussex; in the main people aged 0-18 years of age, in some instances up to 25 years.</p>

<p>The information collated aims to answer some basic questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the characteristics of the population aged 0-24 years in West Sussex?</li>
  <li>What are the risk factors and protective factors affecting the mental health and emotional wellbeing of the population?</li>
  <li>What are the mental health, emotional and behavioural conditions and needs requiring commissioned services?</li>
  <li>What services are currently provided to meet those needs?</li>
  <li>How well are services currently provided to meet those needs?</li>
  <li>What gaps/barriers, if any, need to be addressed?</li>
</ul>

<p>While a range of data have been collated, at the heart of this work are the experiences and views of children and young people, parents, carers and professionals. The needs assessment was conducted by researchers in the Public Health, Health and Social Care Commissioning Directorate,
with consultation fieldwork undertaken between October 2013 and December 2013.</p>

<h4 id="YP14">Analysis of the West Sussex 2011 Year 11 cohort</h4>
<p><small>Date added: 24/08/2012</small></p>
<p>This report looks at educational attainment of Year 11 Pupils in 2011 at Key Stage 4 (GCSE) along with pupil progress in core subjects (English, Maths and Science) between Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4.</p>

<p>79% of students achieved 5+ A<em>-C grades in all subjects, while 59% of students achieved 5+ A</em>-C grades when including English and Maths.</p>

<p>This is similar to the national figures but compares averagely with neighbouring counties.</p>

<p>The results also show that there is a strong correlation between social deprivation and educational attainment, particularly for Maths and Science.</p>

<p>Variations in attainment were also observed between districts with a higher percentage of pupils from Horsham achieving grade A*-C compared to pupils in Adur.</p>

<p>Exclusion from school either temporarily or permanently is associated with poorer attainment. Pupils that have been excluded (between September 2007 and December 2010) were 3 times less likely to achieve 5+ A*-C grades (including English and Maths) compared to non-excluded pupils.</p>
