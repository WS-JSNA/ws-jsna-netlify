# Welcome to the West Sussex JSNA Website Github Repo

A new look for the West Sussex JSNA website, implemented in [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com) and using the [minimal mistakes theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

You can view the site [here](https://jsna.westsussex.gov.uk/).

This version is hosted on netlify, so we can use [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) for the search function.
