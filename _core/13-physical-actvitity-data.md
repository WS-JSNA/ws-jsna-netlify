Maps relating to the physical activity briefing by Lizzie Vass. The purpose of this briefing is to provide an overview of physical activity levels across West Sussex and how this has changed over time. 

The briefing itself will be published here soon.

## Key Messages
1.	_West Sussex has a greater proportion of respondents who were physically active (70.4%) compared to regional (70.16%) and national figures (67.1%)._ 
2.	_Highest levels of physical activity were observed amongst males in West Sussex and physical inactivity appeared to increase with age â€“ these trends were observed at local authority and small area level._   
3.	_Crawley had a consistently higher level of physical inactivity across the West Sussex lower tier local authorities._
4.	_There are data quality issues to be aware of when interpreting trends of physical activity across West Sussex. For example, there is missing data for physically active children and young people and the breakdown of physically active adults by ethnicity due to small sample sizes._
5.	_Supporting travel behaviour change, such as encouraging individuals to consider walking and cycling when completing shorter journeys, should be prioritised within the county. West Sussex had a significantly lower proportion of respondents walking for travel compared to national figures, at 13%. Mid Sussex and Horsham had a significantly lower proportion of respondents cycling to work compared to national average (0.3% and 0.7% respectively)._ 
6.	_Adur, Crawley and Worthing have a higher average number of parks, public gardens and playing fields compared to the Southeast. However, recent data on the utilisation of outdoor space for exercise or health reasons is needed._
7.	_Adur and Worthing had over 99% of postcodes within a 900m radius of a park, public garden or playing field (equivalent to a fifteen-minute walk)._
