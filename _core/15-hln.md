The Oxford Consultants for Social Inclusion (OCSI), in collaboration with the Independent Commission on Neighbourhoods (ICON)  developed a ‘Hyper-local Need Index’ which assesses socio-economic challenges across small areas in England.

This index was published in February 2025 and consists of five dimensions, based on the national missions set by the Labour government. This index measures how far neighbourhoods in England are from achieving the Government’s five mission objectives.

This briefing will provide a summary of the overall measure of hyper-local need and scores for West Sussex.
