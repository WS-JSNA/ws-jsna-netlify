excerpt: "We have undertaken research to learn more about lifestyles of specific age-groups in West Sussex."

Lifestyle surveys are undertaken at regular intervals to give a better understanding of the lifestyles of specific age-groups and to identify any health and wellbeing issues that may be present. 


## Younger People 

In the younger age-groups, these lifestyle surveys also aim to estimate the prevalence of high-risk behaviours and to give insight into the attitudes young people have towards them. The results of the surveys have been made available to schools, local residents, governing bodies and other relevant agencies to inform and improve the development and commissioning of appropriate health promotion interventions. 

These surveys fill in a knowledge gap, in the lifestyles, health and attitudes of an age-range that is often overlooked. This is especially true of the 16-24 age-group, who, often no longer being in school and with a poor response to postal surveys, are a difficult group to reach. Adolescence and early adult life is a key time of transition, however, when behaviour, thinking and beliefs are undergoing rapid change. It is important that services understand the needs of these groups so that appropriate policies and services can be developed and the gap between child and adult services be bridged.

## Older People

There has also been a lack of robust local information on lifestyle factors which impact on older people’s health and well-being. 

Lifestyle surveys for this age-group were designed to collect information on demographics, social and health factors and vulnerability of older people in West Sussex. The information collected here aims to help health and social caring services in meeting the specific needs of the older population in West Sussex.
