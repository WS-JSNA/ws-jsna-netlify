Alcohol misuse is a major risk factor for early death in England and contributes to many health conditions that can lead to illness and disability. However, the prevalence of risky drinking and the harms connected with alcohol consumption are not spread evenly across society. A Health Equity Audit (HEA) is an approach to exploring how fairly resources, opportunities and access are distributed according to the needs of different groups of people.

In this HEA series, we sought to understand the West Sussex picture of people drinking at hazardous, harmful or probable dependent levels. 

A [Short Read](/assets/pdf/alcohol-hea-series/1.1 Short Read HEA - HEA series.pdf) summary report is available now which provides an overview of the HEA methodology, findings and recommendations with further detailed reports published in time. 

The HEA series is intended to provide local evidence to support equitable access to treatment and outcomes, whilst underpinning the development of a strategic approach to alcohol in West Sussex.

On this page, you can find set of resources, including definitions of the tools and datasets we have used and interactive maps and infographics to support local commissioning and other stakeholders which we will be updating over time.

At the bottom of the page you can find all of the reports from the series for download.

### The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)
Throughout this HEA series we have used the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) as a measure of risky/hazardous alcohol consumption.

There are 10 questions around alcohol consumption, drinking behaviours and alcohol related problems to understand alcohol consumption and harm. This gives a score between 0 and 40. A score of 0-7 indicates low risk. Scores above 8 denote increasing and higher risk drinking. Specifically, a score between 8 and 15 denotes potentially hazardous risk levels of drinking. Harmful risk levels of drinking are indicated by AUDIT scores of 16-19 and a score of 20 or more is indicative of probable dependence.

### Estimating local alcohol consumption and estimated need

Based on an estimated population of 726,900 residents (aged 16 and over) and a national prevalence assumption of increasing or higher risk drinking (AUDIT score 8 and over) we estimated that approximately 133,600 people in West Sussex are consuming alcohol at levels risky to their health and may benefit from support.
This includes more than 8,000 residents drinking at probable dependence levels (see table below).

The maps show estimated counts of people in each audit category by ward and therefore, largely correlate to areas that have larger populations. This information provides a visual representation of the areas where we might reasonably expect to see the most need. -->
