Primary Care Networks (PCNs) are organised around GP-registered patient lists, generally serving populations of 30,000 to 50,000 individuals. They are structured to deliver personalised care while operating at a scale that facilitates meaningful impact and promotes collaboration among local health and social care providers.

The dashboard below incorporates key indicators, including data from the National GP Profile (OHID), general health status insights from the 2021 Census, and an overview of GP-registered populations provided by NHS Digital. We recommend that you click on the double headed arrow at the bottom right to open up the dashboard in full screen (hit ESC to exit).
