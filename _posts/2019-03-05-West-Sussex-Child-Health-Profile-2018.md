The Public Health and Social Research Unit have updated the Child Health Profile for West Sussex.

The profile brings together health and wellbeing data on the child population (from birth to 19/24 years) in West Sussex. The data can be presented at different geographies (such as Children and Family Centre boundaries, Integrated Prevention and Earliest Help hubs etc.), allowing for comparisons to be made between areas of West Sussex, and with national estimates.
