This briefing details the information published by the Department of Communities and Local
Government (DCLG). The Indices of Deprivation 2019 (ID2019) updates the 2015 indices.

The ID2019 measures relative deprivation, i.e. how deprived one area is compared with another; it
doesnâ€™t measure absolute deprivation, i.e. how deprived an area is compared with how deprived it was
a year ago.

The overarching methodology for the IMD remains, with the seven domains of deprivation unchanged: -
income, employment, education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, and living
environment.

While the methodology for most of the domains has remained the same, some minor changes have
been made to the Income domain due to the move towards Universal Credit.

For each domain there is an individual score and ranking, information from the domains are weighted
and combined to provide an overall score and ranking.

### Map
