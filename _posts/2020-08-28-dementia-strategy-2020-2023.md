The [West Sussex Joint Dementia Strategy (2020 - 2023)](/assets/ageing-well/dementia-strategy-2020-2023-v14.pdf) has been developed in partnership with the NHS West Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), Social Care, District and Borough Councils, and Community and Voluntary providers, and includes direct input from people with the lived experience of dementia.

The strategy, which aims to improve the health and wellbeing of local people and to support those who develop dementia to maintain their independence and enjoy a good quality of life for as long as possible, formally launches in September 2020 and will run for three years. 

A Dementia Partnership Group, comprising statutory and voluntary and community sector organisations, will also be formed. This group will work together to ensure that people living with dementia, and family and friend carers, have a good experience of living with dementia in West Sussex.
