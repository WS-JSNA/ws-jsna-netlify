West Sussex Health and Wellbeing Board published its draft PNA and is inviting organisations and residents to give their feedback on the draft.

The Health and Wellbeing Board has a statutory responsibility to publish and keep the PNA up to date. The PNA assesses the pharmaceutical service needs of the population of West Sussex. This includes services such as prescriptions, medical appliances and health advice provided by pharmacies, dispensing doctors and appliance contractors.  The PNA looks at whether these services meet the current and future needs of the residents of West Sussex and identifies any gaps in services. It is used by NHS England and Improvement (NHSE&I) to inform market entry decisions relating to applications for new, or changes to existing pharmaceutical services.

You can find further details and the draft PNA at [www.westsussex.gov.uk/pna](www.westsussex.gov.uk/pna) or at [https://yourvoice.westsussex.gov.uk/pnaconsult](https://yourvoice.westsussex.gov.uk/pnaconsult). After reading the draft PNA, the best way to feedback is to complete the consultation response form available online. The consultation is open from **Monday 20 June** until **Sunday 28 August 2022**.
