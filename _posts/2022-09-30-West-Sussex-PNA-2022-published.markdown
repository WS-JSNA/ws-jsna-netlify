The West Sussex Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA) has now been published.

The PNA assesses the pharmaceutical service needs of the population of West Sussex. This includes services such as prescriptions, medical appliances and health advice provided by pharmacies, dispensing doctors, and appliance contractors.  The PNA assesses whether these services meet the current and future pharmaceutical needs of the residents of West Sussex and identifies any gaps in services. It is used by NHS England to inform market entry decisions relating to applications for new, or changes to existing NHS pharmaceutical services.

The West Sussex Health and Wellbeing Board has a statutory responsibility to publish and keep the PNA up to date.
