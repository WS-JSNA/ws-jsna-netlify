The West Sussex Suicide Prevention Framework and Action Plan for 2023-27 sets out how key partners in West Sussex will work together to reduce the risk of suicides.

Suicide is the biggest killer of men aged 49 and under and the leading cause of death in people aged 20-34 years in the UK. It is widely recognised that suicides are preventable.

The partners for the Framework and Action Plan include:

- West Sussex County Council
- Councils (including district, borough and parish councils)
- NHS Sussex
- Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust
- Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) sector
- Sussex Police.

It is aligned to the [Sussex Suicide Prevention Strategy and Action Plan 2024-2027](https://westsussex.moderngov.co.uk/documents/s44178/Appendix%201.pdf) and also the national [Suicide Prevention Strategy 2023-2028](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/suicide-prevention-strategy-for-england-2023-to-2028).
