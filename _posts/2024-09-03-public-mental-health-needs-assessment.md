This all-age public mental health needs assessment is part of the Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA). The JSNA is a statutory requirement for public health that looks at the current and future health, wellbeing and care needs of local populations to inform and guide the planning and commissioning services, this may include strategies, action plans and frameworks for delivery. This is a full needs assessment designed to be used as a commissioning tool to inform mental health and wellbeing services and support, this is not a strategy, action plan or framework for delivery. This report informs and guides future work and is intended to support health and care partners across West Sussex on this important agenda.

> "The JSNA was introduced to create stronger partnerships between communities, local government and the NHS, providing a firm foundation for commissioning that improves health and social care provision and reduces health inequalities."

The objectives of this needs assessment are to:

* Identify and describe guidance, and local policy in relation to mental health and wellbeing across the lifespan from perinatal, birth to older age.
* Describe the prevalence of mental ill health and Identify groups in the local population who may be at higher risk of poor mental health or dementia.
* Describe services and identify strengths, assets, gaps, barriers and unmet needs.
* Capture the view and experiences of service users, professionals and local organisations supporting people with mental health issues, dementia and their carers.
* Describe the impact of COVID-19, cost of living and other challenges on mental health needs and services.
* Provide evidence-based recommendations for action.

This needs assessment report can be used to shape county wide approaches to mental health and wellbeing commissioning and provision, it supports the identification of needs and gaps as well as what is working well within the system. 

The needs assessment covers the following population cohorts: 
* Perinatal mental health 
* Early years: conception to 5 years of age
