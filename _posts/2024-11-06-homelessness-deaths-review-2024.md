Homelessness is an experience that drives social exclusion and inequalities in outcomes. Amongst people experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness, co-occurring health and care needs are common, as are overlapping or prior experiences of social exclusion and disadvantage, such as substance misuse, mental ill-health, time spent in prison, domestic abuse, poverty and adverse childhood experiences. 

In England and Wales, the average age of death of people experiencing homelessness is estimated at around 43-45 years. Over the last decade, the estimated number of deaths amongst people experiencing homelessness in England and Wales has doubled.

To contribute to the local evidence base around the issues faced by this group, this report presents a review of themes identified in the client death reports and cases histories held by local homelessness and housing support organisations.

The aim of this review is to understand the histories, risk factors and vulnerabilities in the lives of people who died within a three-year period (2020/21 – 2022/23) whilst engaged with homelessness and housing support services in West Sussex. 

This report:
+	Explores issues relating to the health of people experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless.
+	Presents data from homelessness organisations’ case histories on the suspected causes of death of a number of people who have died in this group.
+	Will support the work of organisations and services working with this group, both singly and together.

This report does not:
+	Present data on the official causes of deaths of people in this group.
+	Describe increases or decreases in the number or rates of death (mortality trends) in people in this group.
+	Contain recommendations for activity or action. 

The findings of this report can be used to support the work of organisations and services working with this group, both singly and in partnership as a joined-up health, care and social support system. Consideration of the report’s findings will support systems to improve the health and care of this vulnerable population.
