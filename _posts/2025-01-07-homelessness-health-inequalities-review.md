People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face significant inequalities in health outcomes and in access to healthcare services. Co-occurring needs and health conditions are common amongst this group and often overlap with additional risk factors which act to compound disadvantage and inequalities in outcomes. As one of societyâ€™s most vulnerable and socially excluded groups, significant attention is needed to improve health outcomes and reduce health inequalities amongst PEH.

This rapid literature review provides an up-to-date overview of quantitative studies estimating the extent of health and healthcare inequalities for PEH, alongside qualitative studies exploring the perceptions of PEH and the professionals who support them, around barriers and facilitators to accessing healthcare in the UK.
