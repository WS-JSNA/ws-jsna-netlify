The Your Health Matters Survey sought to understand health behaviours at a local level following the pandemic.

The funding for the survey could only be used up to April 2024, we left data collection to the very last point we were able to, and long after pandemic restrictions were lifted.

We kept the survey as short as possible, and it is restricted to the remit of health and health inequalities. Keeping the survey short meant that some subjects were not included, including sexual health, use of healthcare, and drug misuse.

We wanted more information about the health of people in the most disadvantaged areas. Therefore, the sampling strategy for this survey used deprivation as the key criteria.

This slide deck is an initial summary of key points. A second slide deck in the links below provides more detail. More reports and information will be released in future.
