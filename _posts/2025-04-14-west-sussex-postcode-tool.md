A Postcode Lookup Tool has been created to allow users to match a set of inputted postcodes to a range of geographies (e.g. LSOA, electoral ward, district/borough). This file contains approximately 61,000 postcodes in the West Sussex area and was last updated in April 2025.

Please note: postcodes and other boundaries change regularly. Some postcodes may be not be the most up to date, and may be missing or terminated. In addition, lookups to other, secondary sources (such as deprivation and rural-urban classifications) should be done so with caution. These classifications relate to geographical areas at particular points in time and are not always directly comparable to more recent geographical boundaries. This tool should be used with these caveats in mind.
