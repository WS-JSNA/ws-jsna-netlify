The West Sussex Sexual Health Needs Assessment 2025 aims to assess how the needs of the population in relation to sexual and reproductive health are being met in order to help plan services and inform wider actions to improve sexual health and wellbeing of the West Sussex population. This needs assessment forms part of the West Sussex Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA). 

Sexual health is defined by the World Health Organisation as :

“A state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.”

This has guided the four topics explored in this needs assessment, which are:
-	Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
-	Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
-	Reproductive health
-	Healthy relationships 

This needs assessment has recognised that sexual health is important across the life course, though at different ages sexual health needs can differ. It has been undertaken using a mixed methods approach, utilising both quantitative and qualitative approaches to gather data and assess how the needs of the population in relation to sexual and reproductive health are being met. The qualitative work included listening to views of local residents through a survey and gathering perspectives from a range of stakeholders across West Sussex in statutory and voluntary sector organisations through interviews, focus groups and a roundtable event.
