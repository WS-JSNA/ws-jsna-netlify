The new **West Sussex Joint Local Health and Wellbeing Board Strategy** sets out the West Sussex Health and Wellbeing Board’s overarching plan for improving health and wellbeing for residents and communities and reducing inequalities across the county. You can read it at this page on the county's website. [View the West Sussex Joint Local Health and Wellbeing Board Strategy 2025 to 2030](link).

With a vision of ‘Improving Lives together in West Sussex’, the strategy focuses on five priority areas and three principles which are central to the delivery of the strategy.  

The five priority areas are: 
+	Food and nutrition 
+	School readiness 
+	Transitioning to adulthood – children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing 
+	Tobacco control  
+	Health and wellbeing in temporary accommodation 
 
The strategy also includes three principles, that we will: 
+	Reduce health inequalities, including tackling the wider determinants of health  
+	Build resilient and connected communities, including addressing loneliness and social isolation across the life-course  
+	Work in partnership to deliver the strategy
