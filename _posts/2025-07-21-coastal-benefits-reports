In 2024, a [Framework for Action to Reduce Health Inequalities in Coastal West Sussex](/reports/subject-specific-needs-assessments/coastal-health-inequalities/) was developed. 

This framework included a commitment to undertake further analysis and research to extend our knowledge of our coastal communities, including understanding health outcomes and the determinants of health.

As part of this commitment, we have produced a series of reports exploring economic hardship in coastal West Sussex. This largely draws from data on benefit claims released by the Department for Work and Pensions via StatXplore, which is available at small areas. 

These reports focus on:

+ The number and proportion of children living in low-income families in Coastal West Sussex

And benefits claims among older people including:

+ Attendance Allowance: a non-means tested benefit for pensioners who need help with a disability or health condition/s   
+ Pension Credit:  a benefit for pensioners on low income to help with living costs
+ Housing Benefit: a benefit for pensioners on low income to help cover the cost of rent

## Key messages:

+ Key findings for each benefit have been summarised in a [slide deck](/assets/pdf/coastal_briefings/2025_07_Summary_of_Benefit_Claims.pdf) (PDF, 1.2Mb) and detailed reports exploring differences in coastal and non-coastal areas of West Sussex are available:
