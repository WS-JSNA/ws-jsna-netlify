The rise of childhood obesity in England and the implications of obesity persisting into adulthood is a public health concern. Obesity in childhood can have a significant negative impact on the health and emotional wellbeing of children and young people. Obesity in adults is a risk factor for other health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and some types of cancer and may also impact on mental health.

The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) is an annual record of height and weight measurements of children in reception and year 6. 

This data pack contains analysis of 2023/24 NCMP data for West Sussex, with breakdowns by age, sex, area (based on postcode of the child), deprivation and ethnicity.  This includes local analyses conducted by the Public Health and Social Research Unit alongside published data from: 

+	NHS England Digital: [National Child Measurement Programme, England, 2023/24 School Year](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme/2023-24-school-year)
+	Office for Health Improvement and Disparities: [Obesity, Physical Activity and Nutrition Profile](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/obesity-physical-activity-nutrition)
