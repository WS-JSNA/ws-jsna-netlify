## Sussex Public Health Outcomes Framework 2025
The NHS Sussex Public Health Outcomes (POF) indicators data tool is an interactive report showing the latest outcomes framework indicators for NHS and local authority organisations across Sussex across 12 domains. Some indicators have demographic breakdowns by age or sex; for example, life expectancy at birth is reported for males and females separately).

The tables in this report show one row per indicator with each area/organisation’s latest value, a comparison against England, a recent trend, and rankings among demographically similar peers and national ranks, displayed for a quick glance of the State of Sussex.

The tool is available below (this opens in a new window):

In this report, we talk about ‘outliers of concern’ as being any value for an area/organisation which is either significantly worse than the corresponding England value or if the value is in the bottom quartile (25% of areas) when ranked best to worst nationally.

There are a total of 226 indicators. Of these, 73 are indicators of concern; that is indicators with at least one area with an outlier value of concern. This is 32.3% of indicators. 

Some of these indicators are CORE20Plus5 indicators and NHS Health Inequalities 2024 Statement (HIState) indicators. These are identified with in the domain tables throughout the report. Data provided here are usually available for local authority geographies (East Sussex and West Sussex upper tier and Brighton and Hove unitary authorities, referred to as UTLAs) or for the equivalent Sub-ICB locations.

The tool is expected to be updated over time.
