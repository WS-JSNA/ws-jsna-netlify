### Introduction

Children and young people's health and wellbeing are key public health priorities. Up-to-date data and information on the lives of children and young people is integral to WSCC and their ability to work with partner organisations to improve children and young people's lives.

In Spring 2025, data on the health and wellbeing needs of children and young people living in West Sussex was collected through a pilot survey called "The School Health Check". This survey gathered health, wellbeing, and lifestyle data from children aged 8 to 18. A total of 59 schools participated in the survey, which included 10 secondary schools, 4 special schools, and 46 primary schools, yielding nearly 7,000 responses.
  
Summary data, though not representative of all children and young people in West Sussex, offers important insights to inform county-wide commissioning and programme delivery to help improve health outcomes.

The survey also links in with and helps inform the West Sussex Joint Health and Wellbeing Strategy (2025-2030), Foundations for our Future Strategy (2022-2027) and the West Sussex Children and Young People's Plan (2022-2025).
