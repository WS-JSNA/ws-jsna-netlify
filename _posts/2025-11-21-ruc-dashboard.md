The [Rural Urban Classification](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/ruralurbanclassifications/2021ruralurbanclassification) (RUC) is a statistical classification produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It provides a consistent and standardised method for categorising geographies as either rural or urban. The most recent classification used the 2021 Census.

The 2021 RUC is based on:

* address density
* physical settlement form
* population size
* relative access to major towns and cities (populations of over 75,000 people)
