The Joint Strategic Needs Assessment Summary - which provides a brief run through of the health and wellbeing issues at county level, highlighting the various reports we've produced over the year, such as detailed needs assessments relating to specific subjects or communities, evaluations of new local programmes or activities, local surveys, a range of briefings and other ad hoc analyses - can be downloaded below. We're currently working on this year's JSNA Summary, ready for publishing later in the year.
