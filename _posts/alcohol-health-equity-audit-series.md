Alcohol misuse is a major risk factor for early death in England and contributes to many health conditions that can lead to illness and disability. However, the prevalence of risky drinking and the harms connected with alcohol consumption are not spread evenly across society. A Health Equity Audit (HEA) looks at how fairly resources, opportunities and access are distributed according to the needs of different groups of people.
 
This is the summary report of an HEA that sought to understand the West Sussex picture of people drinking at hazardous, harmful or probable dependent levels. The report provides an overview of the HEA methodology, findings and recommendations. The HEA is intended to provide local evidence to support equitable access to treatment and outcomes, whilst underpinning the development of a strategic approach to alcohol in West Sussex.
