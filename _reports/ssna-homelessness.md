# West Sussex Homelessness Needs Audit (2016)

This needs assessment was a result of a collaboration between Homeless Link, Worthing Churches Homelessness Project, West Sussex County Council (WSCC), Adur & Worthing Council and a number of charitable organisations. Through joint working, and an earlier report jointly commissioned by WSCC and Sussex Police, it became clear that there was both an opportunity and a need to examine and asses the needs, strengths and assets of the homeless population; the infrastructure and policies supporting them; and the organisations working with homeless people.
