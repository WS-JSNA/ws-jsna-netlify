In May 2016, West Sussex County Council commissioned the Institute of Public Care at Oxford Brookes University to provide a comprehensive needs assessment of the life pathway for people with disabilities. A number of methods were used to obtain a qualitative assessment of the needs of people with disabilities across the life pathway, including workshops, interviews, and surveys of both staff and families.

As part of the ‘discover’ phase of a longer-term project to redesign of services, the comprehensive needs assessment of the life pathway for people with disabilities in West Sussex aimed to:

+ Review evidence on good practice
+ Describe and map current pathways
+ Assess what is working well and what needs improvement
+ Gather and review existing stakeholder views
+ Gather information on support services, e.g. transport, community provision
+ Compare West Sussex with other local authorities

The project was carried out in five stages: epidemiological analysis, evidence review, mapping of current needs and services, comparison with other local authorities, and the preparation of this final report and recommendations.
