Each Health and Wellbeing Board has a statutory duty to revise and publish a Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA) within 3 years of its previous publication. The PNA looks at the provision and availability of pharmaceutical services provided by pharmacies, dispensing doctors and appliance contractors. It is used by NHS England, Clinical Commissioning Groups and Local Authorities in making decisions about pharmaceutical services. It also contains information about West Sussex such as population growth, age profiles, deprivation and local health and wellbeing priorities.

### The 2018 West Sussex PNA

The 2018 PNA for West Sussex is now complete. West Sussex residents and pharmaceutical service providers were consulted for their views during the development of the PNA and feedback is included in the full report and appendices. The PNA concluded that current services are adequate to meet pharmaceutical needs. However, it recommended that there is scope for improving patient access and choice for certain services and geographic areas.

The 2018 PNA consists of the following documents:

* [Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment: Executive Summary (2018)](/assets/core/West-Sussex-PNA-2018-Executive-Summary.pdf)
* [Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment: Full Report (2018)](/assets/core/West-Sussex-PNA-2018-Full-Report.pdf)
* [Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment: Appendices (2018)](/assets/core/West-Sussex-PNA-2018-Appendices.pdf)
