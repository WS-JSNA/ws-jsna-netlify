### What is the PNA?
Since April 2013, every Health and Wellbeing Board (HWB) in England has had a statutory responsibility to publish and keep up to date a statement of the needs for pharmaceutical services of the population in its area. This is referred to as a Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA).

The PNA:
* looks at the current provision of pharmaceutical services across West Sussex
* decides whether this meets the current and future needs of the population
* identifies any potential gaps to service delivery. 

The PNA is a key document which is used to inform decisions about applications for new, or changes to existing, pharmaceutical services. It is also used to inform the commissioning of NHS-funded, and Public Health funded services that can be provided by local community pharmacies.

The PNA consists of the following documents:
