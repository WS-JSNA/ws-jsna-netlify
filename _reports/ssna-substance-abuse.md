Drug Action Teams were established by the Government in 1995 to ensure the strategic co-ordination of local action on drug misuse. In 2012, the West Sussex Drug & Alcohol Action Team (WSDAAT) was incorporated into Public Health England (PHE) with a view to transfer to the management of West Sussex County Council in April 2013. 

The government’s 2010 Drug Strategy sets out to tackle drugs and address alcohol dependence, which it identifies as key causes of societal harm, including crime, family breakdown and poverty. This strategy aims to:
+ reduce demand
+ restrict supply
+ build recovery in communities.

The government’s 2012 Alcohol Strategy similarly plans to crackdown on the UK’s ‘binge drinking’ culture, cut alcohol-fuelled violence and disorder and reduce the number of people drinking to damaging levels.

The 2014 Drugs and Alcohol needs assessment was externally commissioned by WSCC and focuses on the diverse needs of West Sussex communities and considers the changing trends and market forces related to alcohol and substance misuse. It was designed to reflect proposals to restructure the current adult treatment model i.e. to streamline pathways into a more person-centric treatment and support provision across specific geographical areas throughout West Sussex. 

The report noted the need for:
+ stronger integration and links to other services, such as maternity, mental health, specialist inpatient and specialist adult social care services  
+ an increased emphasis on recovery and provision/mapping of peer support and self-help groups 
+ improved support for children and young people e.g. support those with parents/carers with substance misuse problems, improve staff training, expand provision of Alcohol Identification and Brief Interventions, ensure adequate early intervention programmes and improve co-ordination of school education work
+ an examination of the apparent under-use of some services, including the Structured Day Service and the local residential Tier 4 detox and rehab service
+ commissioners to review the assessment panel process for Tier 4 and ensure that Tier 4 treatment options should be considered at the start of a treatment journey, not as the last resort
+ commissioners to examine the access and take up of services by people from diverse groups, e.g. BAME groups and people living in rural areas.
