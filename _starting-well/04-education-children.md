### West Sussex School Health Check

In Spring 2025, data on the health and wellbeing needs of children and young people living in West Sussex was collected through a pilot survey called "The School Health Check". This survey gathered health, wellbeing, and lifestyle data from children aged 8 to 18. A total of 59 schools participated in the survey, which included 10 secondary schools, 4 special schools, and 46 primary schools, yielding nearly 7,000 responses.
