The Health4Families Programme (H4FP) is an evidence-based framework that supports the integrated childrenâ€™s workforce (e.g. professionals working in health services, early years, and the private and voluntary sectors) to improve the health outcomes of children and families in West Sussex.  

To support this programme, the Public Health and Social Research Unit have produced data summaries to describe the health and wellbeing of children in each Early Help area in West Sussex. The 2019 summaries bring together data relating to the 14 priority topics of the Health4Families Programme and provide links to relevant local and national data and resources.

In previous years, the Public Health and Social Research Unit have also produced a Child Health Profile. This profile is an interactive dashboard that summarises a wide range of data including demographics (e.g. population estimates, births), deprivation (e.g. index of multiple deprivation), health and wellbeing (e.g. hospital admissions, obesity) and education (e.g. absence and exclusion, Early Years Foundation stage). The most recent version of the profile (2018) is available to download below.
