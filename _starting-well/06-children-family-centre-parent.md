The Public Health and Social Research Unit have updated the West Sussex Child Health Profile. 

The profile is an interactive dashboard that summarises a wide range of data including demographics (e.g. population estimates, births), deprivation (e.g. index of multiple deprivation), health and wellbeing (e.g. hospital admissions, obesity) and education (e.g. absence and exclusion, Early Years Foundation stage).

The profile presents a wealth of data at the geographical area of the user’s choice (such as Children and Family Centre boundaries, Education Localities, Integrated Prevention and Earliest Help (IPEH) hubs, district and boroughs etc.).

The newest Child Health Profile **supersedes** those for previous years and former Children and Family Centre Profiles.
