NHS Digital have released the [National Child Measurement Programme 2017/18](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/national-child-measurement-programme/2017-18-school-year) results for the 2017/18 school year.

Children in reception class (aged 4 to 5 years) and year 6 (aged 10 to 11 years) have their height and weight measured to assess overweight and obesity levels in children within state-maintained primary schools. This data is used at a national level to support local public health initiatives and inform the local planning and delivery of services for children.

The West Sussex Public Health and Social Research Unit have completed a data briefing and a summary slide set to summarise childhood obesity prevalence at a local level.

## Key Facts

+ In England, **more than a fifth** of reception children were overweight or obese, and in year 6 it was over a **third**. 

+ In West Sussex, prevalence of obesity was **lower than national** levels; with 19.5% of reception age children (4-5 years old) and 28.3% of year 6 children (10-11 years old) measured as overweight or obese.

+ Within local authorities, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is varied. Worthing had the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity among reception children (23.0%) and Arun had the highest prevalence among year 6 children (32.1%)

+ **Inequalities in childhood obesity persist**. For both school years, prevalence of excess weight among children living in the most deprived areas of West Sussex is greater than those living in the least deprived areas.
